### Motivation

#### The Discovery Problem

The topic of personal blogs comes up often on HN but lately, it's been getting a little crazy.
I presume since people are isolated, they are seeking new exotic stuff to read and what's better than an obscure rant-filled-proofreadless-blog?

Right but the search is dominated by big news publishing companies. Top stories are skewed because of the requirement for them to be [AMP](https://amp.dev) compatible.
They are removing that [requirement soon](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/googles-top-stories-to-show-more-than-just-amp-pages/370792/), hopefully.

And there is a lot more you have to do to get in the search results. There are lot of players trying to fuck you over.
[Here](https://yvoschaap.com/weblog/another_mass_hijack_attempt_of_the_google_search_results) (slice) is a scummy company
creating websites to get in google search results by verifying themselves as the real businesses.

> Search is pioneering uselessness with all the AI fad, SEO hacks, ads, thousands of fake websites, domain squatters and many more "evil" sitting in the same room for finding exocitism.

##### So how to discover novelty?

Medium? Dev.to? Reddit? Probably shouldn't. They all start nice and good. I used to spend time answering questions and reading answers on Quora when it was brand new.
Duckduckgo's CEO wrote answers on it and [seems like still do](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gabriel-Weinberg). But I stopped using it after it gain mass adoption. The thing died a painful death for me.
My feed was full of what is x + y or promotional ads. Ads everywhere. Someone would ask a question and then answer it with crappy promotional links to get in search results. Quora did some hacks to get on search results that often, I guess and people tried to take advantage of that.

None of those platforms care about you as a person. They care about the content you produce. They care about selling it and making money out of it. They care how you would click on promotional links from their platform.

By posting on the platforms that deploy hacks and dilute the web, you are just encouraging a worse web. You might be getting views or engagement for short term but over time, it will be over
when they don't make money from the content you produce or you as a consumer.

The reason you don't find novelty anymore is because it doesn't sell itself. if it sold itself to the lowest common denominator (or the masses), it wouldn't be novelty or exotic.
Big platforms optimize for selling more.

##### How is this project or site related to that?

Let's do a recap -

- Big platforms require profit.
- Profit require things to sell.
- Novel things don't sell themselves after mass adoption.
- Bigger audience attract SEO and marketing bats and displace good content.
- User after honeymoon period is shackled because of wider adoption and visibility.

How can we solve this? [yahoo directory](https://searchengineland.com/the-yahoo-directory-is-finally-absolutely-dead-236663).

Oh c'mon, why would you bring something so ancient. Well, ancient things work sometimes, don't they?

This site is using SSR and 'semantic html' but it's more powerful. You can extend it to have dynamic content like SPA. If you asked a few years ago when SPAs were the new hot thing,
everyone would have told you that only js will be bundled and deployed to your browser on every site. There would be devs not knowing html or css but instead react/jsx and styled components. But that didn't happen...
I mean, ignore few odd cases.

Old saying, what goes comes back.

I want to see individual directories for the web. This is why I built this site. I want people to self host their own yahoo directory containing fun websites and blog. It should be different this time. It should be open and easily transferrable (all design choices are made in that direction).

This one is mine and you should start your own. Please link me if you do. I can help you if need.
